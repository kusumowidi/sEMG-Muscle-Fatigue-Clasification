# Application of Convolutional Neural Network Methods in Muscle Fatigue Classification Based on Handgrip Strength Estimation Using Surface Electromyography (sEMG)
This study classifies muscle fatigue using custom CNN and ResNet50 models, based on handgrip strength estimations from Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) converts sEMG signals into time-frequency representations for CNN input.
