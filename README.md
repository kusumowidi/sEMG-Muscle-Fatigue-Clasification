# sEMG-Muscle-Fatigue-Clasification
This study classifies muscle fatigue using custom CNN and ResNet50 models, based on handgrip strength estimations from Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) converts sEMG signals into time-frequency representations for CNN input.
